Repo for ride-sharing challenge

Overview of the analysis:

The following analysis aims to provide an insight into Ride-sharing by reviewing the provided info (data-bases), this challenge extracts the required info with the help of Jupyter Notebook, using panda and matplotlib to map and display overall aspects of ride-sharing such as user factors and parameters which allow for a more thorough understanding of tendencies, overall location and system factors that are found to follow a pattern to determine the most profitable ride type and tendencie to improve user experience and availability.


Results:
Merged data shows the average fare per city for a specific date.

Overall rides for rural, suburban and urban locations as well for fares; average per ride and driver point to more usage in urban locations, this suggests an area of study in order to improve usage in rural and suburban rides, factors associated (work, university, shopping, leisure or specific reasons account for more usage) as well as fares and driver availability should be taken into account to increase usage.

Summary: 

Review shows areas of improvement in rural and suburban rides:
-Adjust price according zone, rural locations imply more traveling distance therefore fuel consumption and time account for increased rates, by ofering discounts for more traveled routes and frequent traveller incentives should improve comsumption.
-Ride sharing aims to minimize negative impacts related to emissions, reduce travelling costs and congestion by focusing on vehicle ocupancy a higher rate of usage can be achieved while lowering emissions for the same route so an incentive for groups sharing a trip and frequency could be implemented.
-A solution for economic and bussines barriers would be to open a monthy subscription wether on private or public transport according usage frequency, which could allow for a partial subside in order to reach more customers.
